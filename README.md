Design with JavaCode and Uml Diagram

The Design Patterns used in this Implementation correspond to:

- Singleton Pattern: Used to define a single access point for the creation of different objects such as Product and User.

- Pattern Factory Method: Used to create groups of objects such as Product and User.

- Patron State: Used to create an object associated with the user's state of mind and thus be able to obtain the recommended content for said user in relation to their state of mind.
